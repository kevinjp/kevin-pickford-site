<i><hr size="3" no shade></hr>i use writing to cope with my mental health problem's. i believe it helps in some ways with my mental health.
For example creating my stories and characters are just two ways it helps as it created an escape for me and makes me happy to immerse myself
in my own created world. i also believe you can live out through your characters lives the way's you wish you could live yourself</i><hr size="3" no shade></hr>

<h1>i have had mental health probems for a long time now, maybe even most of my life, it may have been undiagnosed or untreated longer than treated and diagnosed, it affects every part of my life.
i always had the mistake, and sometimes still do, that keeping it to yourself is the best way to deal with it. but thaat's is when i wasn't exploding out with my anger and my problem's.
take it from me, that is a mistake, for many reasons, mainly because if it is surpressed, it will come out one way or another, with me, it affected every part of my life, yes really.</h1>
<br></br>
<h1>Take it from me who has had mental health problems since, well, maybe since i was a very young, do not keep it to yourself, seek help.</h1>
<br></br>
<h1>i believe anybody can achive success, whatever it may be, i believe if you work hard enough, keep working hard, never give up, and choose the right ways of working towards your goal, then you can achieve success, if not the level of success you were after, then at least a different level of success.
i mean look at me, i never thought i would bhe able to write publish my own books but i did, in chose a more realistic lower level of achieving one of my dreams, by publishing them on amazon</h1>
